###Convert the input image to grayscale.
###Split the image into MÃ—N tiles.
###Correct M (the number of rows) to match the image and font aspect ratio.
###Compute the average brightness for each image tile and then look up a suitable ASCII character for each.
###Assemble rows of ASCII character strings and print them to a file to form the final image
